## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Expo Go app (on your iOS/Android phone)

### Install and Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ch3xmate/ExpenseTracker.git
cd ExpenseTracker
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the App:

You can start the Expo development server using one of the two options below:

**Option 1 (Basic Start):**

```bash
npx expo start
```

**Option 2 (Clear Cache + Tunnel - if Option 1 fails to connect your phone):**

```bash
npx expo start -c --tunnel
```

>The `-c` flag clears the Metro bundler cache, and `--tunnel` helps establish a connection if your device can't connect over LAN.

4. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.
